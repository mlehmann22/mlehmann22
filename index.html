        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Combine flour and salt in a bowl. Make a well in the centre. Gradually add soda water or beer, using a whisk to stir until well combined.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add oil to large saucepan or wok. Heat over medium heat to 190C (when oil is ready, a cube of bread turns golden brown in 10 seconds).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Dip 4 pieces of fish, one at a time, into batter to evenly coat and deep-fry for 3-4 minutes or until crisp and golden. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towel. Repeat with remaining fish pieces, reheating the oil between batches.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 220C. Lightly grease a baking tray.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place the flour, sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Add the cream and lemonade and mix to form a soft dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured workbench and knead lightly until combined. Press the dough with your hands to a thickness of about 2cm. Use a 6cm round cutter to cut out 8 scones, place on baking tray and brush the tops with some milk. Re-roll scraps to make a few extra scones. Bake for 10-15 minutes until lightly browned. Serve warm with lemon curd and whipped cream.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 200°C.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Toast the pine nuts in a large ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until golden and smelling fantastic, tossing occasionally.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Crack the eggs into a large mixing bowl, crumble in the feta, then grate in the Cheddar. Season with a pinch of black pepper and a couple of pinches of dried oregano.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Finely grate in the lemon zest, drizzle in a little oil, then toss in the toasted pine nuts. Mix well.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Melt the butter in the frying pan over a medium heat with a drizzle of oil, add half the spinach, stirring until wilted, then when there’s space, add the remaining spinach, stirring regularly until wilted.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Lay a 50cm strip of greaseproof paper out on a clean work surface, rub lightly with oil and scrunch up, then flatten out again.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Arrange 4 sheets of filo in a large rectangle on the greaseproof paper, overlapping at the edges, so that it’s almost covering the greaseproof.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Rub the filo with a little oil, sprinkle with sea salt, pepper and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Repeat until you have 3 layers.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Stir the wilted spinach into the egg mixture, then grate in half the nutmeg and mix well.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Slide the greaseproof and filo into the empty frying pan, so that the edges spill over, then push down into the sides of the pan.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Pour in the spinach mixture and spread out evenly, then fold the filo up over the filling to cover.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Place the pan over a medium heat for 2 minutes, just to get the bottom cooking, then transfer to the top shelf of the oven for 18 to 20 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Delicious served with a fresh seasonal salad.
